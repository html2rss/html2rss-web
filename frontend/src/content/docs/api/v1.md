# REST API v1

The REST surface mirrors the applicationâ€™s feed lifecycle. Keep requests small, use HTTPS, and send tokens over TLS only.

## Base URL

```
https://your-domain.com/api/v1
```

## Authentication

Send a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header unless stated otherwise.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://your-domain.com/api/v1/feeds
```

## Response Envelope

Every JSON response returns `success`, `data`, and `meta` keys. Errors replace `data` with an `error` object.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Feeds

### GET /feeds

Returns the feeds the current token can access.

### POST /feeds

Creates a feed. Provide the source URL, a human-readable name, and an optional strategy.

```http
POST /api/v1/feeds
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "name": "Example Feed",
  "strategy": "ssrf_filter"
}
```

Successful responses include a signed `public_url` that exposes the feed without credentials.

### GET /feeds/{id}

Returns feed metadata by default. Set `Accept: application/xml` to stream the RSS document.

### PUT /feeds/{id}

Updates the feed. Currently the service accepts strategy changes only.

### DELETE /feeds/{id}

Removes the feed metadata. Public URLs remain valid while cached clients hold the signed link.

## Strategies

### GET /strategies

Lists available extraction strategies and whether they can be used in the current environment.

### GET /strategies/{id}

Returns details for a single strategy.

## Health

### GET /health

Requires the dedicated health token. Returns overall status and environment metadata.

### GET /health/ready

Readiness probe. No authentication required.

### GET /health/live

Liveness probe. No authentication required.

## Error Codes

| Code                  | Status | Meaning                   |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| `BAD_REQUEST`         | 400    | Input failed validation.  |
| `UNAUTHORIZED`        | 401    | Token missing or invalid. |
| `FORBIDDEN`           | 403    | Token lacks permission.   |
| `NOT_FOUND`           | 404    | Resource unavailable.     |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR`      | 500    | Server-side failure.      |
| `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | 503    | Temporary outage.         |

## Backward Compatibility

Legacy endpoints such as `/api/feeds.json` and `/auto_source/*` were removed. Direct feed URLs (`/{feed_name}`) remain for compatibility.

## OpenAPI Definition

Fetch the OpenAPI 3.0 document at `/api/v1/docs` and load it into tooling such as Swagger UI when you need interactive exploration.

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Create a feed
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/v1/feeds" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com","name":"Example News"}'

# Retrieve the signed public URL from the response and share it as read-only access
curl "https://your-domain.com/api/v1/feeds/eyJwYXlsb2FkIjoi..."
```
