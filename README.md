# html2rss-web

html2rss-web converts arbitrary websites into RSS 2.0 feeds with a slim Ruby backend and an Astro-powered frontend.

## Highlights
- Responsive Astro interface with gallery and custom feed creation.
- Automatic source discovery with token-scoped permissions.
- Signed public feed URLs that work in standard RSS readers.
- Built-in SSRF defences, input validation, and HMAC-protected tokens.

## Architecture
- **Backend:** Ruby + Roda, backed by the `html2rss` gem for extraction.
- **Frontend:** Astro static site with progressive enhancement.
- **Distribution:** Docker Compose by default; other deployments require manual wiring.

## Documentation
The in-repo docs live under `frontend/src/content/docs/` and are published by Astro.
- [Configuration Guide](frontend/src/content/docs/configuration.md)
- [Security Guide](frontend/src/content/docs/security.md)
- [REST API v1](frontend/src/content/docs/api/v1.md)
- [Testing Overview](frontend/src/content/docs/testing.md)

## REST API Snapshot
```bash
# List available strategies
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  "https://your-domain.com/api/v1/strategies"

# Create a feed and capture the signed public URL
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/v1/feeds" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com","name":"Example Feed"}'
```

## Deploy with Docker Compose
The supported path is Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites
- Docker Engine and Docker Compose
- Git for cloning the repository

### Steps
1. Clone the repository and change into the directory.
2. Generate a 64-character hexadecimal key: `openssl rand -hex 32`.
3. Update `docker-compose.yml` with the key via the `HTML2RSS_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.
4. Start the stack: `docker-compose up`.

The application serves the UI and API at `http://localhost:3000`. It fails fast if the secret key is missing.

## Frontend Development
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The Ruby server continues to serve the production build while Astro runs with hot reload on port 4321.
